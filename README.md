# Student Management System

A tutorial series by the [Quick Programming](https://www.youtube.com/@QuickProgramming) YouTube channel. The goal of
this tutorial is to write an application in PHP using Object-Oriented Programming techniques. This repo will follow
along as closely as possible to the original code, taking minor liberties along the way. I will document my journey
through this and try to highlight where I have strayed form the author's original code and why.

Each episode (video) will be noted with its own branch using the video number and title so that it can be easily found.
